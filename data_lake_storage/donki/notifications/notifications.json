The solar energetic particle event was also detected by GOES at 2024-01-03T20:05Z, when the already elevated flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded the threshold of 10 pfu (see notifications 20240103-AL-003 and 20240103-AL-004). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the heightened activity from Active Region 13536: mainly the X5.0 flare close to the East limb in the previous reporting period (see notifications 20231231-AL-002 and 20231231-AL-003) and the associated R-type CME (see notification 20240101-AL-001), with possible additional contributions from the subsequent lower M-class flares from Active Region 13536. The energetic flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was significantly elevated but remained below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. The proton fluxes at SOHO and GOES subsided to below their respective threshold levels on 2024-01-05. The energetic particle fluxes at all three locations have since decreased to background levels.  \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events at SOHO and GOES described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-01-04  01:08:00  01:22:00  01:16:00   M1.1   N02E38 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-04  01:22:00  02:12:00  01:55:00   M3.8   N04E38 ( 13536 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-06T08:12Z     ~706            C               -15/-10               10                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-04T00:00Z     ~732            C              -163/18                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-04T01:36Z     ~893            C              -121/24                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-05T01:53Z     ~552            C               -32/-14               22                          STEREO A                          \n2024-01-06T06:11Z     ~545            C              NONE(POS)/-12          25                          SOHO     \n2024-01-06T16:12Z     ~729            C              -149/33                17                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-08T13:25Z     ~571            C               -44/-32               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-09T06:48Z     ~624            C                75/31                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-09T15:48Z     ~674            C               -26/-36               41                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-10T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2024-01-16T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are ten numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13536 (N07W56) produced two M-class flares early in the reporting period as well as multiple C-class flares throughout it and will possibly generate some activity before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-01-13. Active Region 13538 (N20W77) has been the source of C-class flaring but will soon be rotating behind the limb. Finally, a lower M-class flare was produced today by a yet unnumbered Active Region right on the Eastern limb (at around S20 latitude). This Active Region may exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. An increase in geomagnetic activity might be observed  at the beginning of the outlook period due to a possible glancing blow from the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-01-06T17:36Z. Further increase in geomagnetic activity might happen on or around 2024-01-12 due to a possible glancing blow from the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-01-09T15:48Z mentioned above, possibly combined with an influence from the diffuse southern coronal hole which crossed the central meridian on 2024-01-09, as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA, and might become geoeffective on or around 2024-01-13. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

There were 13 C-type CMEs and 1 R-type CME (see details below).\n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the R-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-31T22:00Z may give a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-01-02T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20240101-AL-001). The arrival of this CME was possibly detected by DSCOVR at L1 at 2024-01-03T04:50Z (see notification 20240103-AL-002). Analysis of this arrival signature is ongoing. \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-27T01:48Z OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-28T18:31Z (see notification 20231227-AL-001).\n2023-12-27T04:00Z Mars at 2023-12-31T19:00Z (glancing blow).\n2023-12-31T10:00Z OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-01-01T23:31Z (see notification 20231231-AL-001).\n2023-12-31T22:00Z Solar Orbiter at 2024-01-02T07:00Z, Juno at 2024-01-11T00:18Z, Psyche at 2024-01-03T12:30Z (glancing blow), STEREO A at 2024-01-02T23:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240101-AL-001).\n2024-01-02T11:09Z OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-01-04T06:00Z (glancing blow), Mars at 2024-01-07T03:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240102-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.00 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nDuring the reporting period, there was a solar energetic particle event detected by SOHO. At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-01-02T23:22Z (see notification 20240103-AL-001). This solar energetic particle event may be associated with an X5.0 flare from AR 13536 (N04E80) which peaked at 2023-12-31T21:55Z (see notifications 20231231-AL-002 and 20231231-AL-003) along with an associated R-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-31T22:00Z (see notification 20240101-AL-001). The observed elevation in one or more of the >15.8 MeV proton channels was gradual and continued to oscillate around the 10^(-1) pfu/MeV threshold through the end of the reporting period. Analysis of this SEP event and all possibly associated activity is ongoing. The energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A were elevated above background levels during the latter part of the reporting period but did not exceed their respective thresholds of 10 pfu and 10^(-1) pfu/MeV before the end of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at SOHO.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-31  18:44:00  19:40:00  19:12:00   M1.0   N04E80 ( 13536 ) \n2023-12-31  21:37:00  22:08:00  21:55:00   X5.0   N04E80 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-01  08:33:00  09:04:00  08:54:00   M2.3   N03E70 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-01  11:54:00  12:35:00  12:25:00   M4.7   N03E68 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-02  18:02:00  18:56:00  18:30:00   M1.1   N05E59 ( 13536 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-31T22:00Z     ~2184           R               -60/-14               45                          SOHO\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-27T01:48Z     ~508            C                77/2                 23                          SOHO, STEREO A     \n2023-12-27T03:12Z     ~537            C         NONE(POS)/-12               45                          SOHO                  \n2023-12-27T03:24Z     ~646            C              -164/-18               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-27T03:36Z     ~516            C              -141/-11               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-27T04:00Z     ~564            C               156/-32               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-27T04:12Z     ~517            C              -159/-24               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-29T02:48Z     ~771            C              -120/-18               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-30T09:36Z     ~671            C               -30/-57               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-30T19:24Z     ~765            C                45/65                24                          SOHO              \n2023-12-31T10:00Z     ~703            C                61/37                35                          SOHO, STEREO A \n2023-12-31T15:27Z     ~576            C         NONE(POS)/27                20                          SOHO\n2023-12-31T18:00Z     ~655            C         NONE(POS)/-63               16                          SOHO\n2024-01-02T11:09Z     ~617            C               122/-22               40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-01-09T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13536 (N05E37) was responsible for the notable X-class and M-class flares observed during the reporting period and this region may continue to exhibit additional flaring activity as it transits the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period.\n \nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole structure centered near S30E28 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) could become geoeffective during the latter part of the outlook period on or around 2023-01-07. Recently, the flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES exceeded the threshold of 10 pfu starting at 2024-01-03T20:05Z (see notifications 20240103-AL-003 and 20240103-AL-004). The >10 MeV integral proton flux at GOES is currently sustained above or near the 10 pfu threshold and this elevation may persist throughout the beginning part of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor to moderate levels during this reporting period with 5 M-class flares and 9 C-type CMEs (see details below).\n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-24T13:25Z may give a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-28T01:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-4 (below minor) (see notification 20231224-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-21T06:09Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-22T15:36Z (see notification 20231221-AL-003).\n2023-12-22T00:24Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-23T19:07Z (see notification 20231222-AL-001).\n2023-12-22T01:25Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-23T19:07Z (see notification 20231222-AL-001). \n2023-12-22T05:12Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-23T19:07Z (see notification 20231222-AL-001).\n2023-12-24T13:25Z    Solar Orbiter at 2023-12-27T13:00Z (glancing blow) and STEREO A at 2023-12-28T02:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20231224-AL-001).\n2023-12-26T00:12Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-27T18:07Z (see notification 20231226-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp<=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-12-20T00:00Z-03:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the possible arrival of the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-16T01:48Z detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-20T00:26Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-12-21T13:35Z (see notifications 20231221-AL-001, 20231221-AL-002, and 20231223-AL-001) and remained elevated until returning to background levels early on 2023-12-24. These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the combined arrivals of the CME first seen at 2023-12-14T17:38Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231221-7D-001), a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-12-18, and the CME first seen at 2023-12-16T01:48Z detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-20T00:26Z mentioned above.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained near or slightly above background levels for the entire reporting period.

The most notable of these, Active Region 13529 (S21W62), produced two of the M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit similar levels of activity during the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor for the upcoming week. A large coronal hole currently centered near S15E25 (stretching from N10E10 to S30E50) will begin to cross the central meridian by the end of 2023-12-28. The western most portions of this coronal hole may reach geoeffective longitudes by the end of the outlook period. We are still awaiting the potential glancing blow of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-24T13:25Z where minor geomagnetic conditions are possible.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at high levels during this reporting period with 1 X-class flare, 5 M-class flares, 7 C-type CMEs, and 2 O-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-13T00:00Z associated with a C2.8 flare from AR 13514 (N06W25) peaking at 2023-12-12T22:55Z may impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-15T15:13Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20231213-AL-002). The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-12-15T10:57Z (see notification 20231215-AL-006). STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments have also likely detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-12-15T12:41Z. \n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2023-12-14T17:38Z associated with an X2.8 flare from AR 13514 (N05W54) peaking at 2023-12-14T17:02Z (see notifications 20231214-AL-005, 20231214-AL-006) may impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-16T18:51Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 5-7 (minor to strong) (see notifications 20231214-AL-007, 20231215-AL-001, and 20231216-AL-002). An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 24 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-12-16T15:53Z and 2023-12-17T09:58Z (average arrival 2023-12-16T22:15Z) for 75% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 79% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-6 range (below minor to moderate). Full details of the modeled event are available here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/Detailed_results_20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055.txt (see notification 20231216-AL-002). The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231217-AL-002). STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments also likely detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-12-17T00:30Z.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-13T00:00Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-14T09:08Z, Psyche at 2023-12-16T07:15Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-12-15T15:06Z, STEREO A at 2023-12-15T13:13Z (see notification 20231213-AL-002)\n2023-12-13T15:05Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T09:47Z (see notification 20231215-AL-001)\n2023-12-14T07:00Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T18:00Z (see notification 20231215-AL-001)\n2023-12-14T08:36Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T18:00Z (see notifications 20231215-AL-001)\n2023-12-14T17:38Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T18:00Z, Psyche at 2023-12-17T08:42Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-12-16T23:48Z, STEREO A = 2023-12-16T16:59Z (see notifications 20231215-AL-001 and 20231216-AL-002).\n2023-12-15T07:48Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-16T10:44Z, STEREO A at 2023-12-18T07:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20231215-AL-009)\n2023-12-17T18:36Z   Lucy = 2023-12-23T00:00Z (minor impact)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period (see notifications 20231218-AL-001 and 20231218-AL-002). The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-12-18T06:00Z-09:00Z. This moderate geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231217-AL-002) which was likely associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2023-12-14T17:38Z (see notifications 20231214-AL-007, 20231215-AL-001, and 20231216-AL-002). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-12-17T10:54Z (see notifications 20231217-AL-001 and 20231217-AL-003).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nAdditionally, there was a solar energetic particle event detected by SOHO and GOES. At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-12-15T15:42Z (see notification 20231215-AL-008). At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-12-15T23:45Z (see notifications 20231215-AL-010 and 20231216-AL-001). This solar energetic particle event is likely associated with and influenced by several preceding events which collectively contributed to the observed enhancements. Such events include the observed X2.8, M6.3, and M6.9 flares from Active Region 13514 on 2023-12-14 and 2023-12-15 (see Flares section below for more details), the CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-12T00:00Z, 2023-12-13T00:00Z, and 2023-12-15T07:48Z in addition to the the CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2023-12-14T17:38Z (see CMEs table below for more details), and the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231217-AL-002). The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was elevated during the reporting period, but remained below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. On 2023-12-17, the particle environment subsided to background levels at all locations and subsequently remained at background levels through the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO and GOES.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-14  07:11:00  08:00:00  07:44:00   M5.8   N05W50 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-14  13:29:00  14:08:00  13:48:00   M2.3   N05W52 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-14  16:47:00  17:12:00  17:02:00   X2.8   N05W54 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-15  07:03:00  07:23:00  07:15:00   M6.3   N03W59 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-15  07:23:00  07:43:00  07:34:00   M6.9   N02W66 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-17  20:08:00  20:21:00  20:17:00   M1.1   N05W90 ( 13514 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-13T00:00Z     ~696            C                17/2                 36                          SOHO, STEREO A                                \n2023-12-14T17:38Z     ~1081           O                33/-4                49                          STEREO A, SOHO                          \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-13T15:05Z     ~616            C                59/8                 27                          SOHO, STEREO A                     \n2023-12-14T07:00Z     ~684            C                83/-30               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-14T08:36Z     ~517            C                50/-18               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-15T07:48Z     ~1101           O                60/-22               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-16T05:48Z     ~676            C         NONE(POS)/0                 27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-17T18:12Z     ~558            C         NONE(POS)/71                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-17T18:36Z     ~691            C               100/-2                29                          SOHO, STEREO A      \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-26T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are several numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13519 (S11W58), 13521 (N11E03), and 13529 (S19E27) have produced several C-class flares during the latter part of the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Two coronal hole structures currently centered around S35W25 and N25W07 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective during the first half of the outlook period on or around 2023-12-22. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux was elevated above background levels on 2023-12-20 and such elevated levels may continue to be observed throughout the beginning part of the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-12-16T14:07Z and 2023-12-17T10:19Z (average arrival 2023-12-16T21:41Z) for 91% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-12-16T15:53Z and 2023-12-17T09:58Z (average arrival 2023-12-16T22:15Z) for 75% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 79% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-12-14T17:38:00-CME-001) was also predicted to affect OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T20:40Z and give a glancing blow to Psyche at 2023-12-18T04:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20231214-AL-007).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/Detailed_results_20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055.txt\n\n\n"

There are currently ten Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13540 (currently situated around S20W88) and Active Region 13541 (S22W85) have produced low-level C-class flaring towards the end of the reporting period and may continue to exhibit C-class flaring as they rotate beyond the west limb on 2024-01-17. An unnumbered Active Region visible near the eastern limb around latitude N25 (as seen in available EUV imagery from SDO) may exhibit flaring activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week. A coronal hole currently centered around N05W60 (as seen in available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-01-17. In addition, a coronal hole currently centered around N15W05 may become geoeffective on or around 2024-01-20.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

The energetic proton flux of the >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A were elevated during the reporting period, but remained below their respective thresholds of 10 pfu and 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. The particle environment subsided to background levels at all locations on 2024-01-23.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at SOHO.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-01-22  06:09:00  06:30:00  06:22:00   M1.5   N27E27 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-22  19:13:00  19:28:00  19:24:00   M1.1   N25E14 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-22  19:28:00  19:36:00  19:32:00   M1.2   N25E14 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-22  19:43:00  19:53:00  19:47:00   M2.0   S17W27 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-22  21:14:00  21:32:00  21:21:00   M3.4   S18W30 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-22  21:36:00  21:58:00  21:43:00   M1.6   S18W30 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-22  22:19:00  22:26:00  22:22:00   M2.1   S19W30 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  03:09:00  03:38:00  03:31:00   M5.1   N29E18 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-23  07:52:00  08:18:00  08:11:00   M2.4   S18W38 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  08:18:00  08:26:00  08:22:00   M2.3   S18W40 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  13:03:00  13:13:00  13:08:00   M1.0   S18W38 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  14:45:00  15:05:00  14:59:00   M1.3   S18W42 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  16:36:00  16:47:00  16:40:00   M4.3   S17W39 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  18:19:00  18:35:00  18:28:00   M1.0   S17W43 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  18:35:00  18:49:00  18:44:00   M1.1   S16W43 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  19:46:00  19:57:00  19:52:00   M1.0   S17W42 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  19:57:00  20:05:00  20:01:00   M1.0   S17W44 ( 13561 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-20T09:24Z     ~978            C               -18/-22               47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-21T00:36Z     ~1068           O               -33/-3                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T10:48Z     ~746            C                16/-38               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T22:36Z     ~563            C                29/-24               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-23T03:48Z     ~771            C                -9/46                30                          SOHO           \n2024-01-23T04:12Z     ~613            C                26/-30               42                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-23T17:36Z     ~562            C                40/-33               40                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-18T13:25Z     ~772            C               -35/56                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-20T09:36Z     ~584            C               -90/3                 35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-21T03:48Z     ~1180           O               -36/21                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T09:24Z     ~526            C               -63/47                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T19:00Z     ~654            C                90/40                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                                       \n2024-01-23T09:48Z     ~696            C               -16/62                20                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-23T13:36Z     ~629            C               -16/83                29                          SOHO                                                 \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-01-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently seven Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13559 (currently located at N27W12) and Active Region 13561 (currently located at S17W52) produced M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week. An increase in geomagnetic activity may be observed in the beginning of the outlook period due to the anticipated arrival on 2024-01-25 of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-01-22T10:48Z, the combined arrivals on 2024-01-26 of the C-type CMEs first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-01-22T22:36Z and 2024-01-23T04:12Z, and possible glancing blow arrivals on 2024-01-26 and 2024-01-27 from C-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-01-23T03:48Z and 2024-01-23T17:36Z, respectively. Additionally, two coronal holes currently centered around N40E30 and S16E30 (as seen in available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-01-28.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

There are currently five Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13559 and 13561, which were responsible for multiple M-class flares observed during the reporting period, have rotated off the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13567 (N20E58) has produced several C-class flares since rotating onto the Earth-facing disk around 2024-01-30 and may continue to exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight increase in geomagnetic activity could be observed on or around 2024-02-01 due to a possible glancing blow from the O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-01-29T04:38Z (previously described above). Additionally, coronal hole structures currently centered near S18W20 and S35E15 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective during the outlook period on or around 2024-02-02 and 2024-02-04, respectively. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

There are currently ten Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13575 which was responsible for four most recent M-class flares, including an M5 class flare at the start of the outlook period, is rotating off of the Earth-facing disk today but could still produce some activity in the next two days. Active Region 13576 (S16E36) was responsible for the majority of M-class flaring observed during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity as it transits the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period. One more unnumbered Active Region may soon be rotating onto the eastern limb around latitude N15 as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO.\n \nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low to minor levels during the outlook period. A slight increase in geomagnetic activity might be observed around 2024-02-10 due to a possible glancing blow from a S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-02-06T13:48Z. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

At GOES and STEREO A, proton fluxes had already subsided to below threshold levels prior to current event, while at SOHO the flux of the 15.8-39.8 MeV protons channel still periodically exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV prior to the current SEP event.\n\nThe source of the SEP event is likely a significant CME from behind the SW limb that was detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-02-12T06:36Z. This CME is currently being analyzed. \n\n\n"

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor levels during this reporting period with 7 M-class flares and 9 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-06T08:12Z may give a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-09T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 2-3 (below minor) (see notifications 20231206-AL-001 and 20231207-AL-003). The arrival of this CME was not detected at L1.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-06T08:12Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-08T03:00Z (glancing blow), Psyche at 2023-12-10T05:00Z (glancing blow), STEREO-A at 2023-12-09T12:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20231206-AL-001 and 20231207-AL-003).\n2023-12-07T13:36Z    Mars at 2023-12-10T20:18Z, and Lucy at 2023-12-13T02:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20231207-AL-004 and 20231207-AL-005).\n2023-12-08T16:24Z    Mars at 2023-12-12T21:04Z. \n2023-12-12T19:12Z    Parker Solar Probe at 2023-12-13T22:05Z (see notification 20231213-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.0 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4.0 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-12-12T12:00-15:00Z and was likely associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-12T11:26Z (see notification 20231212-AL-001). This interplanetary shock was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC at 2023-12-13T00:00Z following a data gap that started around 2023-12-12T22:00Z. Analysis of this arrival signature is ongoing. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-12-07T16:25Z (see notifications 20231207-AL-001, 20231207-AL-002, 20231209-AL-001, and 20231211-AL-001) and remained elevated throughout the reporting period until returning to background levels at the end of 2023-12-12. These elevated energetic electron flux levels are associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-12-03 and the possible arrival of the CME with ID 2023-12-01T22:24Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-04T04:30Z during the previous reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-06  05:30:00  05:52:00  05:41:00   M2.1   N19E65 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-06  21:26:00  21:55:00  21:44:00   M2.3   N19E55 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-08  22:57:00  23:14:00  23:07:00   M5.4   S21W50 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  09:41:00  10:06:00  09:55:00   M1.5   S22W57 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  13:03:00  13:37:00  13:19:00   M1.0   S22W58 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  03:42:00  03:58:00  03:53:00   M2.3   S22W67 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  22:37:00  22:47:00  22:43:00   M1.4   S21W77 ( 13511 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T08:12Z     ~506            C                 7/24                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T00:12Z     ~810            C                 1/43                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T00:48Z     ~500            C               180/82                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T13:36Z     ~966            C               163/16                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T02:00Z     ~561            C               100/-55               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T16:24Z     ~650            C               160/31                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-09T04:24Z     ~933            C               164/78                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T11:23Z     ~566            C              -165/-34               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T19:12Z     ~943            C              -116/-28               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently eight numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13513 (currently located at N18W40) produced two M-class flares during the reporting period and may produce additional flaring activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2023-12-17. Active Region 13514 (currently located at N10W34) has been the source of numerous C-class flares during the reporting period and is likely to produce further flaring activity during the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. An equatorial coronal hole structure currently centered near S15W30 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) could become geoeffective early in the outlook period on or around 2023-12-14. An additional increase in geomagnetic activity may be observed around 2023-12-15 due to the anticipated combined arrival of an S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-12T00:00Z and a C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-13T00:00Z (see notification 20231213-AL-002). Finally, a coronal hole structure currently centered near N10E30 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) could become geoeffective during the second half of the outlook period, on or around 2023-12-17.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with 5 M-class flares and 12 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-01T22:24Z associated with the M1.0 flare peaking at 2023-12-01T21:20Z from Active Region 3500 (S18W40) may impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-04T17:17Z (plus minus 7 hours), with an estimated maximum Kp index of 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20231202-AL-003). The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-04T04:30Z. STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments have also likely detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-12-04T08:09Z.\n\nIn addition, the CMEs listed below were simulated to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-01T22:24Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-03T15:31Z, Psyche at 2023-12-05T07:46Z, STEREO A at 2023-12-04T14:53Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-12-04T12:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20231202-AL-003)\n2023-12-03T00:12Z   Mars at 2023-12-08T14:00Z (glancing blow)\n2023-12-03T04:00Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-12-04T20:39Z (see notification 20231203-AL-001)\n2023-12-05T07:48Z   Lucy at 2023-12-12T00:00Z (glancing blow)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period (see notifications 20231201-AL-003 and 20231201-AL-006). The highest value of Kp=7 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-12-01T09:00Z-12:00Z. This strong enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-01T08:48Z (see notification 20231201-AL-004) which was likely associated with the combined arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-11-28T20:24Z and/or the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-11-28T20:48Z during the previous reporting period (see notification 20231129-AL-001). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-12-01T11:04Z (see notifications 20231201-AL-002 and 20231201-AL-005) and again at 2023-12-02T00:46Z (see notifications 20231202-AL-001 and 20231202-AL-002). The significant interplanetary shock mentioned above was preceded by an earlier weaker shock detected at 2023-11-30T23:29Z by DSCOVR at L1, which was likely caused by the combined arrival of CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-11-27T20:12:00Z and 2023-11-27T23:48Z during the previous reporting period (see notification 20231201-AL-001). The two consecutive significant arrivals were likely also detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2023-12-01T00:11Z and 2023-12-01T08:15Z, respectively.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the geomagnetic activity described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-01  04:12:00  05:07:00  04:39:00   M1.1   N12W80 ( 13502 ) \n2023-12-01  20:55:00  22:10:00  21:20:00   M1.0   S18W40 ( 13500 ) \n2023-12-05  06:39:00  06:48:00  06:44:00   M1.5   N18E73 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-05  20:59:00  21:17:00  21:10:00   M1.0   N19E69 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-05  21:17:00  21:25:00  21:20:00   M1.4   N19E69 ( 13513 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-01T22:24Z     ~656            C                38/-20               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-30T23:12Z     ~505            C                90/-61               32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-01T03:24Z     ~588            C                90/31                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-01T07:12Z     ~510            C                12/-37               11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-01T12:36Z     ~602            C                17/-37               15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-01T14:48Z     ~552            C               -56/-48               32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-03T00:12Z     ~582            C               130/-34               38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-03T04:00Z     ~579            C               -80/-17               24                          SOHO, STEREO A  \n2023-12-03T04:24Z     ~587            C            NONE(POS)/41             31                          SOHO, STEREO A   \n2023-12-03T10:12Z     ~558            C            NONE(POS)/-12            23                          SOHO, STEREO A      \n2023-12-03T23:36Z     ~622            C            NONE(POS)/-47            12                          SOHO, STEREO A                 \n2023-12-05T07:48Z     ~619            C                95/-22               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-12T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13513 (currently located at N19E56) produced four M-class flares within the past two days and is likely to continue exhibiting further flaring activity during the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux at GOES has become elevated on the first day of the outlook period but has yet remained under the threshold of 1000 pfu. It is likely to cross the threshold within the next few days. This elevation of the electron flux may be associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-12-03, with the maximum sustained speed of 650 km/s, as well as with the arrival of a CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-01T22:24Z which was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-12-04T04:30Z.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

The leading edge or flank of the CMEs will reach Parker Solar Probe at 2024-02-14T15:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nCME parameters (not updated) are (C-type):\n\n1: Start time of the event: 2024-02-12T14:12Z.\n\nEstimated speed: ~750 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 49 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): -119/15 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2024-02-12T14:12:00-CME-001\n\n\n2: Start time of the event: 2024-02-12T22:18Z.\n\nEstimated speed: ~999 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 50 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): -116/14 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2024-02-12T22:18:00-CME-001\n\n\nLinks to the movies of the modeled event (includes CMEs: 2024-02-12T14:12:00-CME-001, 2024-02-12T22:18:00-CME-001):\n\n(a) 2 AU outer boundary\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240212_191000_2.0_anim.tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240212_191000_2.0_anim.tim-vel.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240212_191000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240212_191000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_PSP_timeline.gif\n\n(b) 5.5 AU outer boundary\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240212_191000_5.5_anim.tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240212_191000_5.5_anim.tim-vel.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240212_191000_5.5_ENLIL_CONE_Juno_timeline.gif\n\n\n## Notes: \n\nThe CME event with ID 2024-02-12T22:18:00-CME-001 is associated with the occluded M2.6 flare from behind the northeast limb with ID 2024-02-12T20:35:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2024-02-12T21:17Z.\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"

The highest value of Kp <= 4.33 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-02-11T00:00Z-03:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2024-02-11T01:18Z which may have been associated with the shock arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-02-09T13:23Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-003, 20240209-AL-009, and 20240209-AL-011). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2024-02-11T03:01Z (see notifications 20240211-AL-001 and 20240211-AL-004). This arrival was also detected by STEREO A at 2024-02-11T02:30Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nTwo separate solar energetic particle events occurred during the reporting period, both of which were detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES.\n\nThe first solar energetic particle event began on 2024-02-09 following the X3.3 flare peaking at 2024-02-09T13:14Z from Active Region 13575 (S37W110) (see notifications 20240209-AL-001 and 20240209-AL-002) and subsequent O-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-02-09T13:23Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-003, 20240209-AL-009, and 20240209-AL-011). The flux of the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV at 2024-02-09T15:09Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-005 and 20240209-AL-006). At GOES, the integral flux of the >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2024-02-09T15:30Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-007 and 20240209-AL-008). At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-02-09T15:52Z (see notification 20240209-AL-010). By the start of 2024-02-12, proton fluxes at GOES and STEREO A subsided to levels just below their respective threshold, while at SOHO the flux of the 15.8-39.8 MeV protons remained elevated, periodically hovering over the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV.\n\nThe second solar energetic particle event began on 2024-02-12 following the ER-type far-sided CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-02-12T06:36Z (see notification 20240212-AL-007). The flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A and the flux of the 28.2-50.1 MeV protons at SOHO exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-02-12T07:41Z. At GOES the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded the threshold of 10 pfu starting at 2024-02-12T08:05Z and the flux of > 100 MeV protons briefly exceeded the threshold of 1 pfu at 2024-02-12T10:15Z (see notifications 20240212-AL-002, 20240212-AL-003, 20240212-AL-004, and 20240212-AL-006). The flux of > 100 MeV protons at GOES subsided below threshold levels after 2024-02-12T10:40Z while all other proton flux channels remained above their respective threshold levels at all three locations (GOES, SOHO, and STEREO A) through the remainder of the reporting period.\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at STEREO A, GOES, and SOHO.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location

Date: 2024-02-14T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-02-20T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13575, which was responsible for multiple M-class flares and one X-class flare observed during the reporting period, rotated off the Earth-facing disk on 2024-02-08 and may continue to be the source of far-sided activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 13576 (S17W63) and newly numbered Active Regions 13585 (N14E49) and 13586 (N25E70) have produced several M-class flares during the reporting period and are likely to exhibit additional flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The SEP event observed during the reporting period on 2024-02-12 has and may continue to persist through the beginning of the outlook period. The integral flux of the >10 MeV protons at GOES and the 13-100 MeV proton flux at STEREO A recently subsided below their respective thresholds on 2024-02-14, but remain elevated above background levels. The flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels at SOHO are currently elevated near or just above the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"
